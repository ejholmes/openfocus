/* If this macro is defined to 1, the boot loader command line utility can
 * initiate a reboot after uploading the FLASH when the "-r" command line
 * option is given. If you define it to 0 or leave it undefined, the "-r"
 * option won't work and you save a couple of bytes in the boot loader. This
 * may be of advantage if you compile with gcc 4 instead of gcc 3 because it
 * generates slightly larger code.
 * If you need to save even more memory, consider using your own vector table.
 * Since only the reset vector and INT0 (the first two vectors) are used,
 * this saves quite a bit of flash. See Alexander Neumann's boot loader for
 * an example: http://git.lochraster.org:2080/?p=fd0/usbload;a=tree
