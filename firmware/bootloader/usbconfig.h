General Description:
This file is an example configuration (with inline documentation) for the USB
driver. It configures V-USB for USB D+ connected to Port D bit 2 (which is
also hardware interrupt 0 on many devices) and USB D- to Port D bit 4. You may
wire the lines to any other port, as long as D+ is also wired to INT0 (or any
other hardware interrupt, as long as it is the highest level interrupt, see
section at the end of this file).
*/
